              <p>Every so often I think that I can make money while gambling on the NFL, so now I'm going to see if that's true or if I would have been better off just putting my money into my savings account. I'm going to record all of my bets here and you can follow along to see how things go.</p>

              <p>I do realize that there are a lot of major corporations who make a ton of money on people betting on the NFL. I'm sure they use huge databases and measure a ton of variables that I don't know about, so that should be interesting.</p>

              <p><b>8/23/19</b> - Cam Newton hurt his ankle in a preseason game last night, which puts my Panthers over 7.5 wins in serious jeopardy. The only upside for me is that I have plenty of time to hedge my bets. My bet on a Rams beating the Panthers in Week 1 is looking good. I hope he has a quick recovery after the first week.</p>

              <p>Furthermore, I put down some money on the Patriots winning the absmyal AFC East. I would like to put more down, but I've limited the betting budget to $300, at this point, so combining that with the money I put down on the Panthers, I don't have a lot of operating capital to work with.</p> 
              <p><b>9/5/19</b> - There are two small bets that are the same on the Packers @ Bears under/over line and they're aren't a typo. I just thought neither team was going to score much. I'm usually very good at being on the wrong side of under/over bets, so it was nice to win two for once.</p>
              <p><b>9/16/19</b> - It's nice to be up on my bets, at least for the time being, but the $120 bet on the Panthers winning more than 7.5 games this year is looming over my head. I've hedged against the $120 twice and won $36.28, but I'm clearly in a rough position.</p>
              <p><b>9/19/19</b> - Betting on the Titans - Jaguars game was dumb. I didn't really care or have any feelings about making the bets, I just did it anyway. Okay, on to this week. I made a two-team parlay bet that the Patriots and Cowboys will both cover their over 20 point spreads. I don't expect to win this bet, but I would like to see it happen. I took the Colts over the Falcons because the Falcons running game has been anemic at best, and they've had a problem
              turning over the ball. I took the Chiefs because the line should be higher. The Ravens are getting a lot of respect for kicking the crap out of the horrible Dolphins, while only beating the Cardinals by 5. Speaking of the Cardinals, I have the Panthers beating them this week. The Cardinals are second in yards allowed and I'm not willing to completely throw in the towel on the Panthers season yet.</p>
              <p><b>9/23/19</b> - I just bet on the under for Bears against Washington, which is at 41, but I accidentally took the over. If I lose, I'll call it a tax on being stupid. If I win, then that's neat and I clearly don't know anything.</p>
              <p><b>9/24/19</b> - I clearly don't know anything.
              <p><b>10/1/19</b> - This week I'm going to try to explain my picks when I make them. What stinks about betting on favorites is that you lose a lot and you win small. I'm 29 - 10 on my picks, but I'm not monumentally ahead. At this point, I would only win 3 cents if all of my futures bets lost.
               <ul>
                 <li>Rams over Seahawks - I like the Rams because they're underdogs and I don't trust the Seahawks, because three out of four of their games, QBs who aren't very good have been close.</li>
                 <li>Bears v. Raiders under 41 - The Bears have averaged scoring 16.5 points a game and allowed 9.5 points a game. The Raiders have scored 19.75 points a game. Combine both averages you get 36 and change. I don't see the Raiders moving the ball against the Bears.</li>
                 <li>Bears to win @ Raiders - Teams don't score against the Bears. This will be a boring game.</li>
                 <li>Two-Team Parlay: Patriots over @ Washington and @ Eagles over Jets - I recently told a fellow gambler and buddy that parlays are stupid. Well, here we go.</li>
